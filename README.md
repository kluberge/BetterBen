# Better Ben's Raincoat

Ben's Raincoat: it's not a good item. 

You're like me; when SOTV first came out, you were shocked and excited by Ben's Raincoat. Negate all debuffs? Sounds busted, but also fun to get in a vanilla run! 

Fun, that's the game design pillar that Hopoo Games has increasingly neglected. 

This is not just a mod, but a message from the community that at the end of the day, fun is more important than balance. Risk of Rain 2 is a game, not an interactive spreadsheet (like **some people** would claim).

To this end, I've created this mod to tweak Ben's Raincoat as follows:

**Ben's Raincoat**

Every debuff received is converted into *10%* barrier *(+10% per stack)*, and this amount is configurable. 

This essentially just takes the pre-patch raincoat and buffs it so that it scales with number of stacks.
